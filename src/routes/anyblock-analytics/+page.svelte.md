# Anyblock Analytics

## Origins and Early Development

We began as [eth.events](https://web.archive.org/web/20180815151043/https://eth.events/), a project developed by [Brainbot Technologies](https://brainbot.com/) specifically to track token sales for their [Raiden Network](https://raiden.network/) Initial Coin Offering. This focused use case revealed to us a significant gap in the blockchain ecosystem: the need for accessible, queryable blockchain data.
Our initial eth.events platform concentrated exclusively on Ethereum data, providing developers with tools to index and query blockchain information in more usable formats. During this formative period, we built technical expertise in transforming raw blockchain data into structures compatible with traditional business systems.

## Evolution into Anyblock Analytics

As blockchain technology diversified beyond Ethereum, we rebranded as [Anyblock Analytics](https://web.archive.org/web/20220315230658/https://www.anyblockanalytics.com/) and expanded our service offerings. This transition reflected our strategic decision to support multiple blockchain networks, eventually growing to include over 20 different Ethereum and Bitcoin-based chains.
We developed several key technical capabilities during this period:

- A blockchain data indexing system with SQL and ElasticSearch query interfaces
- JSON-RPC API endpoints for blockchain interaction
- Custom block explorers and monitoring tools
- Cross-chain connectivity solutions
- Data visualization and dashboard systems

## German Identity

Operating from Mainz, Germany, we established ourselves with a European identity. This positioning helped us build relationships with other European blockchain ventures and align with EU data standards.

## Client Relationships

Throughout our independent operation, we worked with various clients across the blockchain ecosystem:

- [Tangany](https://tangany.com/) (crypto custody)
- [Tatoshi AG](https://tatoshi.io/) (blockchain solutions)
- [DePay](https://depay.com/) (payments)
- [Unibright](https://unibright.io/) (enterprise integration)
- [International Token Standardization Association](https://my.itsa.global/) (research)

These partnerships demonstrated the practical applications of our data infrastructure across different sectors and use cases.

## Acquisition by Blockdaemon

The acquisition by [Blockdaemon](https://www.blockdaemon.com/) marked the end of our journey as an independent entity, but also validated the technical approach we had developed. Blockdaemon, primarily focused on node infrastructure, recognized the complementary value of our data analytics capabilities.
Our integration into Blockdaemon Germany represented a natural consolidation in the maturing blockchain infrastructure space, as specialized service providers combined to create more comprehensive solutions.

## Legacy and Impact

Looking back, our journey from a single-purpose ICO tracking tool to a multi-chain data analytics platform illustrates the rapid evolution of blockchain infrastructure requirements. We successfully identified and addressed critical data accessibility challenges that hindered enterprise blockchain adoption.
The technical approaches and solutions we developed continue to influence blockchain data infrastructure, now as part of Blockdaemon's broader service offering.
